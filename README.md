Welcome to the **Othello** game project!

## Overview
This Python implementation originally featured a console-only mode for Player vs Bot. It has now been updated to include two modes of play: **Player vs Player** and **Player vs Bot**. The project also offers two interfaces: a **Console Interface** and a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, providing an enhanced gaming experience.


### Interfaces
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
